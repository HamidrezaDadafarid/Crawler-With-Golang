# Golang Crawler Project

This project is a web crawling system written in Go that collects real estate advertisement data from various sites and displays them to users based on different filters. Users can interact with the program through a Telegram bot to view search results.

---

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Crawls and collects real estate ads from multiple sources.
- **Advanced Filters**: Users can customize their searches with filters like price range, city, neighborhood, number of rooms, area, and building age.
- **Telegram Bot**: The application includes a Telegram bot that allows users to receive their search results via Telegram.
- **Rate Limiting Management**: The application uses Redis to manage the rate of requests based on different user roles.
- **Data Validation and Normalization**: Input data is validated and normalized to ensure consistency and prevent invalid entries in the database.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Golang** (v1.16+): Primary language of the project.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database used for storing advertisement and user data.
- **Redis**: Manages request rate limits and prevents excessive user requests.
- **GORM**: ORM used for database interactions with PostgreSQL.
- **go-redis**: Library used for connecting to Redis.
- **Telegram Bot API**: For Telegram integration to handle user commands.



## ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

The ERD below illustrates the overall structure of the database, including the entities `Users`, `Filters`, `Ads`, `WatchList`, and `Users_Ads`. Each entity plays a critical role in storing and managing project information.
